     * [`sendChannelMode()`]{@link OutputChannel#sendChannelMode} method for more info.

     * specification.
     *
     * **Note**: messages #0-31 (MSB) are paired with messages #32-63 (LSB). For example, message #1
     * (`modulationwheelcoarse`) can be accompanied by a second control change message for
     * `modulationwheelfine` to achieve a greater level of precision. if you want to specify both MSB
     * and LSB for messages between `0` and `31`, you can do so by passing a 2-value array as the
     * second parameter.
     *
     * @param {number|string} controller The MIDI controller name or number (`0` - `127`).
     *
     * @param {number|number[]} value The value to send (0-127). You can also use a two-position array
     * for controllers 0 to 31. In this scenario, the first value will be sent as usual and the second
     * value will be sent to the matching LSB controller (which is obtained by adding 32 to the first
     * controller)
     *
     * @param {object} [options={}]
     *
     * @param {number|string} [options.time=(now)] If `time` is a string prefixed with `"+"` and
     * followed by a number, the message will be delayed by that many milliseconds. If the value is a
     * positive number
     * ([`DOMHighResTimeStamp`]{@link https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp}),
     * the operation will be scheduled for that time. The current time can be retrieved with
     * [`WebMidi.time`]{@link WebMidi#time}. If `options.time` is omitted, or in the past, the
     * operation will be carried out as soon as possible.
     *
     * @throws {RangeError} Controller numbers must be between 0 and 127.
     * @throws {RangeError} Invalid controller name.
     * @throws {TypeError} The value array must have a length of 2.
     *
     * @returns {OutputChannel} Returns the `OutputChannel` object so methods can be chained.
